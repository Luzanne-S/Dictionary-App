Dictionary-App

The project was made for my bootcamp as one of the workshops.
The brief was to create a dictionary application that allowed the user to type in a word and then the application would produce the following results (if they were availble);
phonetics,nouns, examples, synonyms,and images associated with the word.

The application was created with Create React App and the itegrated the Free Dictionary API and Pexels API
